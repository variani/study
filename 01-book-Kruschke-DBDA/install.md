## JAGS & rjags

### Debian package

1) Install JAGS from an Ubuntu rep

```
add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rrutter
apt-get update
apt-get install jags 
```

### Source

A more tricky was is not install JAGS from source: http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/.

The problem is that installation of rjags becomes complicated in paths, etc.

See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/INSTALL .
